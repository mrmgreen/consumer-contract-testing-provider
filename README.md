# Provider of the API
POC Consumer driven contract testing - Provider/server implementation

Pact is generated by the consumer and imported into the pact directory of this project for now, before I setup the broker system.

Consumer project https://github.com/mrmgreen/consumer-contract-testing-consumer

## Is it safe to deploy
Run `yarn can-i-deploy:<service to deploy>`
Service to deploy could be voucher or products manager.

This will query the broker and exit 1 or 0 depending on the result. It also provides a table as std out with details from the broker.
